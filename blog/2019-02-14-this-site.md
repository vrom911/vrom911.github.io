## Overview

### Syntax

Like, seriously, a _LOT_ of text**

#### Links and Email

An email <example@example.com> link.

Simple inline link <http://chenluois.com>, another inline link [Smaller](http://smallerapp.com), one more inline link with title [Resize](http://resizesafari.com "a Safari extension").

1. Ordered list item
2. Ordered list item
3. Ordered list item

- - - -

#### Headers

Setext-style:

This is H1
==========

This is H2
----------

atx-style:

# This is H1
## This is H2
### This is H3
#### This is H4
##### This is H5
###### This is H6

### Extra Syntax

#### Footnotes

Footnotes work mostly like reference-style links. A footnote is made of two things: a marker in the text that will become a superscript number; a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes at the end of the document. A footnote looks like this:

That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.

#### Strikethrough

Wrap with 2 tilde characters:

~~Strikethrough~~

#### Fenced Code Blocks

Start with a line containing 3 or more backticks, and ends with the first line with the same number of backticks:

```
Fenced code blocks are like Stardard Markdown’s regular code
blocks, except that they’re not indented and instead rely on
a start and end fence lines to delimit the code block.
```
