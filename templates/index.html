            <p>I'm Veronika. Programming is one of my main interests in life. For a few years already I'm enjoying Haskell. Currently, I'm working as a Haskell Developer at <a href="https://www.holmusk.com/" target="_blank">Holmusk</a>. Another thing I'm very proud of is <a href="https://kowainik.github.io/" target="_blank">Kowainik</a> open source organization, which <a href="https://chshersh.github.io/" target="_blank">Dmitrii</a> and I founded in March 2018. So don't forget to check it out as well!</p>

            <p>Here you can find out more information about myself, explore what I do, and read some of my posts. Be my guest!</p>

            <p>And do contact me via details provided at the bottom of the page about anything :) </p>
